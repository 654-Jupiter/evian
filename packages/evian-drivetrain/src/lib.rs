//! Robot drivetrain configurations.
//!
//! This crate provides types for describing and modeling different mobile robot drivetrain
//! configurations. A *drivetrain* in evian is the combination of hardware components (e.g. motors,
//! wheels, and sensors) that enables a robot to both *move* and *track its motion*. This importantly
//! means that drivetrains are a collection of **both** motors and sensors.
//!
//! At the heart of this crate is the [`Drivetrain`] struct, which bundles together some motors and a
//! *tracking system* â€” a system that measures something about the drivetrain as it moves around.
//! The [`Drivetrain`] type could represent many different types of robot drivetrains depending on how
//! the motor and tracking logic is implemented.
//!
//! # Supported Configurations
//!
//! At the moment, this crate currently provides built-in support for [differential drivetrains],
//! however the [`Drivetrain`] struct could in theory be configured to accept any arrangement of motors
//! with your own custom type if you require something else.
//!
//! [differential drivetrains]: crate::differential
