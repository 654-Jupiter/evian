//! Robot Localization and Tracking
//!
//! This module provides traits and types for implementing robot tracking systems
//! that estimate a robot's position and general state of motion over time. A tracking
//! system typically fuses data from multiple sensors (encoders, IMUs, vision, etc.) to
//! maintain an estimate of the robot's:
//!
//! - Position in 2D space
//! - Heading (orientation)
//! - Linear and angular velocities
//! - Distance traveled
//!
//! Several basic implementations of tracking are provided by this module as a reference, with
//! the ability to implement your own custom tracking setups using the [`Tracking`] trait.
